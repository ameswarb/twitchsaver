[Check it out!](https://ameswarb.github.io/twitchsaver/?promo=1)

Webpage that serves up a 3 x 2 grid of cathode tube TVs showing twitch.tv's featured streams. Designed to work with screensavers that load a webpage, such as [webviewscreensaver](https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver).

## Installation

Just clone this repo into any folder being served by a web server.

## Usage

* Add `?theme=modern` to the end of the URL to remove the cathode tube theme and show 100% of the twitch streams.
* Adding `?promo=1` when sharing the project is appreciated
* Protip: if you want to share the modern version, add `?theme=modern&promo=1` to the URL
